The objects will be actual 3D models viewed by the student made of model with lighting and animation Its simply the\r\nmodel with Animation, Lighting and User Interface. The model will be a CAD model of a specific BASE TARGET, documentation, design\r\ndrawing. Human will be eliminated in this context as the entire process can be automated. The AR model can be further used to train human\r\nworkers by creating virtual models of different objects and adding the technical specifications and various functionals.\r\nSOLIDWORKS is used to design a 3D model and then the model is exported in FBX format. FBX format of the model is then imported\r\nin MAYA and the required animation in given the model and again the model is exported in FBX format with the animation and the model is kept\r\nimported in UNITY 3D.By using VUFORIA an AR Tool Kit the base target(using image) or Ground Target(using ground) or User Defined Target\r\n(using any base target) for devices that does not support Ground detection.
