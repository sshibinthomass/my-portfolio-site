The novel\nVR wearable device is 3D printed and a special biconvex lens and a headphone is attached to it. A smart phone used by\nthe individual shall be fixed to the wearable device to provide a VR experience.\n➢ The device also has a novel VR application developed using UNITY software which changes the environment with just\na gaze for a couple of seconds.\n➢ Total Virtual Reality is one of the advanced VR methods where the users can move around in the VR\napplication without physical locomotion. By moving the device at the Human Reading angle, users can move around in\nVR by reducing the usage of the external controller and empowering the user to control the VR environment\nthrough Gestures.\n➢ The application is user-friendly and it helps the users to practice Yoga with virtual guidance simultaneously. The\nYogasana can be performed well in either natural or home environment. Four environmental choices are provided to the\npractitioner, viz, Yoga hall, Natural environment, Gymnasium and Home. The practitioner will be able to move in and\naround and do Yogasana in their place of preference, say, Yoga hall, Natural environment, Gymnasium and House.\n➢ The VR application also has features representing different modes of tratak like spot and candle. Virtual buttons are\nprovided to enable user interaction with the device. Through these buttons, users will be able to control their level of\ninteraction within the Virtual environment from the external world",

The model will be a CAD model of a specific BASE TARGET, documentation, design\r\ndrawing. Human will be eliminated in this context as the entire process can be automated.
